# Mongoose Generator Skill

This skill allows you to generate Mongoose code (Model, Controller, Tests) based on a user request.

## Instructions

1.  **Understand the Request**: Identify the user's need for a new MongoDB collection or feature.
2.  **Generate Code**: Use the prompt template in \`prompts/mongoose.md\`.
    - Replace `{input}` with the user's request.
3.  **Save Files**:
    - Save the generated model and controller code to `output/`.
    - Save the generated test code to `test/`.
