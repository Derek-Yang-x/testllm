# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## File Placement & Organization
1. **Temporary Files**: Do NOT place temporary debug scripts, one-off test files, or scratchpads in the `src/` directory.
   - Use the project root (`./`) or `tmp/` (if it exists) for such files.
   - Always ask for permission before creating new files in `src/` that are not part of the core feature implementation.

## MCP & Code Generation
1. **Tool Usage**: When using MCP tools (like `sequelize-gen`), strictly follow the directory instructions defined in the tool's prompt/template.
2. **Cleanup**: Always clean up temporary files created during debugging sessions once the issue is resolved.
