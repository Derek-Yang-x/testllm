# Project Rules for AI Assistant

## File Placement & Organization
1. **Temporary Files**: Use the project `tmp/` directory for scratchpads, debug scripts, or temporary data. Do NOT place them in `src/`.
2. **Generated Code**: Place generated code (e.g., from MCP tools, models, controllers) in the `output/` directory first for review.
3. **Source Code**: Only move files to `src/` after they have been verified.

## MCP & Code Generation
1. **Tool Usage**: When using MCP tools, strictly follow the directory instructions defined in the tool's prompt/template.
2. **Prioritize MCP**: Always check available MCP tools (e.g., `get-sequelize-prompt`, `get-mongoose-prompt`, `get-antd-prompt`, `list-collections`) FIRST before writing code manually or using other methods. If a relevant MCP tool exists, use it.
3. **Cleanup**: Always clean up temporary files created during debugging sessions once the issue is resolved.
